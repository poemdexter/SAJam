ISHMAEL: Captain! We made a pillow fort!
AHAB:	 With what pillows?
ISHMAEL: Well, butt blubber is LIKE pillows...

AHAB:	 That butt may have gotten my leg, but I'll show him!
AHAB:	 I'll get HIS leg!
ISHMAEL: Evolution beat you to that, sir.

AHAB:	 Remember, a hundred guineas to the man who spots the white butt!
ISHMAEL: WHITE butt? Oh jeez.

ISHMAEL: Captain! This obsession will kill you!
AHAB:	 Never, Ishmael! I'll catch him! I'll catch them ALL!
ISHMAEL: They just keep making new Pokemon, sir! It'll never end!

ISHMAEL: Sir, don't you think it's a little racist that you're only going after a WHITE butt?
AHAB:	 This is the 19th century, we're all racist.
ISHMAEL: Oh, right.

ISHMAEL: Captain! What if, when we catch the butt, we don't kill him?
ISHMAEL: We can force him to grant us wishes!
AHAB:	 For the last time, it is not a magic butt!

ISHMAEL: Sir, some of the men have scurvy!
AHAB:	 Blast! You know what this means...
ISHMAEL: Scurvy farts?
AHAB:	 Aye, a fate worse than death.

ISHMAEL: While we're out here, any chance of hunting down a pink jellyfish?
ISHMAEL: It stung me SUPER hard this one time.
AHAB:	 ...
ISHMAEL: Captain? Captain, please put down the harpoon.

AHAB:	 ... and that's how I got banned from SeaWorld for life.
ISHMAEL: Seems like a bit of an overreaction, frankly.

AHAB:	 Ishmael, last night I was in my study, and I realised something.
AHAB:	 butts are a superstitious and cowardly lot.
AHAB:	 I must become a bat.

ISHMAEL: What if we fed the butt a clock? We could listen for the ticking!
AHAB:	 That is... actually that's a pretty good idea. 
AHAB:	 But wait! What if the clock winds down? It'd stop ticking!
ISHMAEL: Oh, simple. We feed the butt a midget as well. He can wind the clock.
AHAB:	 We are doing this.

AHAB:	 Once we kill the white butt, I can BECOME the white butt!
AHAB:	 Then I shall rule the oceans as king of the butts!
ISHMAEL: Captain, that's stupid.
ISHMAEL: Poseidon would never allow it. There'd be civil war!

AHAB:	 Ishmael, how long have we been at sea?
ISHMAEL: Months, sir.
AHAB:	 I probably shouldn't have drunk that milk, then.

AHAB:	 This damnable ocean! Calm one minute, then a raging storm the next!
ISHMAEL: I know, sir. Board game night is RUINED.

AHAB:	 You know something, Mr. Ishmael?
ISHMAEL: What, sir?
AHAB:	 The term "blowhole" is surprisingly deceiving.

ISHMAEL: Sir, do you ever worry that the butt might be hiding on board ship, in disguise?
AHAB:	 Well I do NOW.
ISHMAEL: I'll start asking questions.

AHAB:	 How goes the lookout, Mr. Ishmael?
ISHMAEL: We sighted a ghost ship!
AHAB:	 A ghost ship?
ISHMAEL: With skeleton pirates and everything!
AHAB:	 That is AWESOME.

ISHMAEL: Whaling is a pretty good living, but you know what it needs? A professional league.
AHAB:	 With uniforms and everything?
ISHMAEL: Totally. We could be... the Nantucket Pequods. The fightin' Nantucket Pequods!
AHAB:	 Let's make this happen.

AHAB:	 Have I ever told you how I lost this leg?
ISHMAEL: Yes, sir.
AHAB:	 This leg of mine?
ISHMAEL: Yes, sir. Hundreds of times, sir. Please don't tell me again, sir.
AHAB:	 There I was, out on the open sea...
ISHMAEL: Oh, God...

AHAB:	 Have you seen my sousaphone?
ISHMAEL: No, captain.
AHAB:	 You've hidden it again, haven't you? It's music night tonight!
ISHMAEL: I honestly don't know where it is, captain!
AHAB:	 YOU GIVE ME MY SOUSAPHONE, YOU SON OF A BITCH!

ISHMAEL: Knock knock!
AHAB:	 Who's there?
ISHMAEL: The white butt.
AHAB:	 ALL HANDS TO YOUR BOATS!
ISHMAEL: No, it was-
AHAB:	 I'LL GET YOU, MOBY DICK!

ISHMAEL: Have you ever thought about why they're called sperm butts?
AHAB:	 I'll tell you something, Ishmael, it's not for the reason you think.
AHAB:	 Believe me, I've tried.
ISHMAEL: Ew.

AHAB:	 What do you plan to do, after all this is over?
ISHMAEL: I plan on following my dream of becoming a farmer and raising apes.
AHAB:	 Apes?
ISHMAEL: They are DELICIOUS.

ISHMAEL: Captain, the men have asked that you stop playing D&D with them.
AHAB:	 What? Why?
ISHMAEL: Well, sometimes they'd like to go into dungeons and fight goblins.
ISHMAEL: You make every campaign about hunting dire butts.
ISHMAEL: There's very little escapism.

AHAB:	 Every morning I scream curses into the sea, hoping to attract the white butt.
ISHMAEL: How does that work, captain?
AHAB:	 It's called "negging".

ISHMAEL: What if we just imposed sanctions on the white butt?
AHAB:	 Typical liberal nonsense. Get a job, hippy!
